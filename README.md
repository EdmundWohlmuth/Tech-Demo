# Engaging "Glue Gun" Mechanic
The "Glue Gun" is a fun tool that enables the player to traverse and interact with the enviroment, sticking to both static and moving objects. The "Glue Gun" has a finite ammount of ammo but can be replenished by ammo pickups found throughout the level.

# A Proof of Concept
The Tech-Demo posseses moving platforms the player can ride, doors and teleporters to access new areas, checkpoints to respawn at and pickups that effect gameplay this is the bedrock for a potential game, and despite being a class project, it had me _glued_ to my seat (yeah, that was a bad joke...)
